# Basic workflow

To run the multi-outbreak parameter estimation procedure you simply need to run the `drc_multi_outbrk.R`.

This script uses the following scripts:
1. 
2. 

Questions:
1. Can we abstract process from the mif2_run function?
2. Why are there two mif runs in that function?


Comments
1. Overall need all like-files to be easy to understand their connection
2. Also need all file connections to be clear and more transparent
  - e.g. main_functions script should be able to be used by each mod we throw at it, if it is specific to the model we use, should be in the specific model script and associated
3. Want functions to be clear and transparent
4. One function - one task
5. What is the second liks_global step of mif2 for?

6. Probably stop it from using the clusters?




2 Different models
6 Different outbreaks

12 different combinations

Figure 1 - comparison between two models for each outbreak - showing estimates and fits

- To get this figure what do we need?
- mif fits for each model/outbreak combination
- confidence intervals for each model/outbreak/parameter combination
